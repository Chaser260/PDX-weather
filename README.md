# PDX Weather Analysis

Prior to moving to Portland in 2011, I lived in Bend, OR. Growing up, I always heard it was constantly dreary and rainy in Portland all year long. However, since moving here, the stories haven't lived up to their hype about the rain. I'm curious to see what the historical precipitation looks like in Portland compared to what it has looked like for the last 10 years, and whether it has been significantly drier than before.

For this analysis, I am going to pull data from the National Centers For Environmental Information for the Portland area and analyze precipitation, as well as other climate related data from the PDX weather station.
