# PDX Weather Analysis

Prior to moving to Portland in 2011, I lived in Bend, OR. Growing up, I always heard it was constantly dreary and rainy in Portland all year long. However, since moving here, I fully expected it to be wetter. I'm curious to see what the historical precipitation looks like in Portland, and whether it has been drier than usual since I moved to Portland.

I am going to use public data from the National Centers For Environmental Information for the Portland area and analyze precipitation, as well as other climate related data from the PDX weather station.
